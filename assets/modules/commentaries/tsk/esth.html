none did compel.Every person drank what he pleased.  Among the Greeks, however, each guest was obliged to keep the round, or leave the company:  hence the proverb [E pithi, e apithi,] Drink, or begone.  Mr. Herbert, in his poem entitled "The Church Porch," has severely reprobated this vile custom.  In Britain, however, this demoralizing custom is now almost destroyed, and a new era of social pleasure is arising, by temperate habits, increased domestic comforts, and the spread of gospel truths.

Vashti.This reasoning was inconsequent and false.  Vashti had not generally disobeyed the king, therefore she could be no precedent for the general conduct of the Persian women.  She disobeyed only in one particular; and this, to serve a purpose, Memucan draws into a general consequence:  and the rest came into the conclusion, being either too intoxicated to be able to discern right from wrong, or too intent on reducing women to a state of vassalage, to neglect the present favourable opportunity.

Mordecai.The apartments of the women are accounted so inviolable, that it is even a crime to enquire what passes within their walls. A man, says Chardin, may walk a hundred days, one after the other, by the house where the women are, and yet know no more what is done there than at the farther end of Tartary.  This sufficiently explains the conduct of Mordecai.

he made.We learn from Herodotus and Athenæus, that the Persian monarchs were accustomed to give their wives distinct cities and provinces for the purpose of supplying them with different articles of dress:  one was assigned for ornamenting the head and neck; another provided robes, zones, etc.; and the city of Anthilla was given to a Persian queen, we read, to supply her with shoes and sandals.  It is probable, therefore, that, at the desire of Esther, Ahasuerus relieved those cities and provinces that had before paid it, from this expense.

the king's servants.Dr. Shaw, speaking of the cities in the East, says, "If we quit the streets, and enter into any of the principal houses, we shall first pass through a porch, or gate-way, with benches on each side, where the master of the family receives visits, and despatches business; few persons, not even the nearest relations, having admission any farther, except upon extraordinary occasions."  These servants were probably officers who here waited the king's call; and it is likely that Mordecai was one of them.

Had this meant only civil reverence the king would not have needed to command it; nor would Mordecai have refused it; there was, therefore, some kind of divine honour intended, such as was paid to the Persian kings, and which even the Greeks refused, as express adoration.

 <a href="Ge 23:16">Ge 23:16</a>;  Here Haman is obliged to acknowledge that there would be a loss to the revenue, which he was willing to make up out of his own property.  Ten thousand talents of silver, counted by the Babylonish talent, amount to 2,119,000£.; but reckoned by the Jewish talent, they amount to double that sum.  In those days, silver and gold were more plentiful than at present; and we have many instances of individuals possessing almost incredible riches.  Herodotus relates, that when Xerxes went into Greece, Pythius the Lydian had 2,000 talents of silver, and 4,000,000 of gold darics, which unitedly amount to nearly 5,500,000£.  Plutarch tells us, that after Crassus had dedicated the tenth of all he had to Hercules, he entertained the Roman people at 10,000 tables, and distributed to every citizen as much corn as was sufficient for three months; and, after all these expenses, he had 7,100 Roman talents left, which amount to more than 1,500,000£.  Lentulus the augur is said to have possessed no less than 3,333,333£. 6s. 8d. Apicius was worth more than 916,671£ 13s. 4d.; and, after having spent in his kitchen 833,333£ 6s. 8d. he considered the remainder too little for his support, and poisoned himself!

It appeared by the event that Mordecai spoke prophetically, when he modestly conjectured that Esther came to the kingdom that she might be the instrument of the Jews' deliverance.  Mordecai thoroughly believed that it was a cause which one way or other would certainly be carried, and which, therefore, she might safely venture upon.  Instruments might fail, but God's covenant cannot.  There is a wise design in all the providences of God, which is unknown to us till it is accomplished; but it will prove in the issue that all is intended for and centre in the good of those who trust in Him.

the banquet.  {Mishteh,} from {shathah,} "to drink," acompotation.  feast, or banquet accompanied with drinking; the drinking in the East being at the beginning, and not at the end of the entertainment. Olearius, describing an entertainment at the Persian court, says, "The floor of the hall was covered with cotton cloth, which was covered with all sorts of fruits and sweetmeats in basons of gold.  With them was served up excellent Shiraz wine.  After an hour's time, the sweetmeats were removed, to make way for the more substantial part of the entertainment, such as rice, boiled and roast mutton, etc.  When the company had been at table an hour and a half, warm water was brought, in a ewer of gold, for washing; and grace being said, they began to retire without speaking a word, according to the custom of the country."

Yea, Esther.Plutarch, in his life of Artaxerxes, informs us, that none but the king's mother, and his real wife, were permitted to sit at his table; and therefore he mentions it as a condescension in that prince, that he sometimes invited his brothers.  Haman, therefore, had some reason to be proud of this favour.

Yet all this.Pride will ever render its possessor unhappy.  Haman, though possessed of immense riches, glory, and honour, and the prime favourite of his king, is wretched, because he could not have the homage of that man whom his heart even despised!

The horse, with him on his back, is led all round the city, which he is several hours in doing.  The apostate is attended with drums and other music, and twenty or thirty serjeants.  They march in order on each side of the horse, with naked swords in their hands.  The crier goes before, with a loud voice giving thanks to God for the proselyte that is made."

India.The Hebrew word {Hoddo,} in Syriac, {Hendoo,} and in Arabic, {Hind,} is rendered India by all the versions.  India, or Hindostan, is a large country of the south of Asia, extending from north to south about 2,400 miles, and from east to west 1,800, between 8 degrees and 35 degrees N. lat. and 68 degrees and 92 degrees E. long.; being bounded on the west by the Indus, east by the Birman empire and Thibet, north by the Indian Caucasus, and south by the Indian Ocean.  It is probable, however, that all the country east of the Indus was anciently called India.

and with a great crown.Mordecai was now made the chief minister, or vizier, instead of Haman; and was accordingly invested with the "royal apparel," in conformity to the custom of the East.  So we are informed, in the History of the Revolt of Ali Bey, that on the election of a new {sheikh bellet,} or chief of the country, in Egypt, the {pasha} who approves of him invests him with a robe of valuable fur.  Perhaps the crown was one of the insignia of the office of vizier.  Concerning the blue, fine linen, and purple, see the Notes on Ex 25:4; 39:27.

what they would.  Heb. according to their will.The Chaldee paraphrast says that none appeared against the Jews but Amalekites only, who were infatuated, and had their hearts hardened, as Pharaoh's against Israel, to take up arms to their own destruction.  Some had such an inveterate, implacable malice against the Jews, that Haman's fall and Mordecai's advancement, instead of convincing, seemed only to exasperate them the more.  How have the most dreadful scourges ravaged a country, and yet the inhabitants are unmindful of the Almighty Disposer of events, and that the cause of his righteous displeasure is their continual provocation!  Forty years long was he grieved with one generation, who learned not his ways, although daily fed and clothed by a miracle.

If it please the king.Esther had probably been informed by Mordecai, that there were still many enemies of the Jews who sought their destruction, who had escaped the preceding day; and therefore begged that the second day might be added to the former permission; and that the sons of Haman, who had already been slain, might be suspended on gibbets, as a terror to those who sought the destruction of the Jews.

sending portions.The eastern princes and people not only invite their friends to feasts, but it is their custom to send a portion of the banquet to those that cannot well attend, especially their relations, and those in a state of mourning.  Thus, when the Grand Emir found that it incommoded M. D'Arvieux to eat with him, he desired him to take his own time for eating, and sent him from his kitchen what he liked best.

 REMARKS ON THE BOOK OF ESTHER.
 This Book, which derives its name from the person whose history it chiefly relates, is termed in Hebrew, [megillâh  'Ectêr ,] megillath Esther, "the volume of Esther."  Concerning its author there are various opinions: some attribute it to Ezra; some to Joachim, the son of Joshua the high priest; others to the men of the great synagogue; and others to Mordecai, which seems the most probable opinion.  The events here related probably refer to the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who, according to Prideaux, was the Ahasuerus of Esther, agreeably to Josephus, (Ant. 1 xi. c.  6,) the Septuagint version, and the apocryphal additions to this book. The history, therefore, comes in between the sixth and seventh chapters of Ezra, commencing about A.M. 3540, and continuing through a period of twelve years:  it relates the royal feast of Ahasuerus; the disgrace of Vashti, (ch. 1:;) the elevation of Esther to the Persian throne; the essential service rendered to the king by Mordecai, in detecting a plot against his life, (ch. 2:;) the promotion of Haman, and his purposed destruction of the Jews, (ch. 3:;) the consequent affliction of the Jews, and the measures pursued by them, (ch. 4:;) the defeat of Haman's plot, through the instrumentality of Esther, against Mordecai, (ch. 5:-7:;) and also the defeat of his general plot against the Jews, (ch. 8:; 9:1-15;) the institution of the feast of Purim to commemorate this deliverance, (ch. 9:16-32;) and the advancement of Mordecai, (ch. 10:;) and though some Christians have hesitated to receive this book into the sacred canon, yet it has always been received by the Jews, not only as perfectly authentic, but also as one of the most excellent of their sacred books.  That it is a genuine and faithful description of a real fact, the observation of the feast of Purim, to the present day, is a sufficient evidence; since it is impossible, and in fact inconceivable, that a nation should institute, and afterwards continue to celebrate without interruption, through every generation of that people, in a long succession of ages, in whatever places they may have sojourned, this solemn annual festival, merely because one of their nation had written an agreeable fable or romance.  It has been remarked, as an objection to this book, that the name of God no where occurs in it:  His superintending providence, however, is frequently illustrated.  It is shewn, indeed, in every part of the work; disconcerting evil designs, and producing great events, by means seemingly inadequate.  It also presents an interesting description of mortified pride, and of malice baffled to the destruction of its possessors; and exhibits a very lively representation of the vexations and troubles, the anxieties, treachery, and dissimulation of a corrupt court.
